During 2020 I took up the role of editing and maintaining the Faculty of IT's weekly newsletter at Monash University. This newsletter is called "The Byte" and every week it provides students with the goings-on around campus and relevant opportunities to network and find employment.

While working for The Byte, I felt that the design was somewhat lacking. It didn't have a clear flow and it was still using the same template from its first issue from almost five years ago.

I wanted to see if I could create something more useful to our readers by providing contextual elements for our issue's items and strengthening our branding by using a more robust colour system and mixing some elements of text within it.

Following the release of the new design, we saw an average of a 17% increase in the follow-through rate.
