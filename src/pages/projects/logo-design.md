*A mock document showing off the logo in a particular context*

The needs for the logo, as described by the faux company was to 'range for any gender from 16-60 years old' so it 'can be identified by as many people as possible', mainly appealing to those with an 'average to high income' or 'sound engineers and music producers'.

The research stage involved the analysis of audio logos, logos from successful companies, and analysing visual elements from music/sound and Minerva's mythology/cult. From this, I decided to extract certain elements, such as waveforms, Minerva's comet, the Owl of Minerva and also how I could manipulate the typography of 'Minerva'. Ultimately I ended up basing the design on the Owl of Minerva while retaining an emphasis on ratios.

Lo and behold, I had created the company's logo, however, I wasn't done yet. I had to present the logo in a way that wouldn't just show the logo, but rather to show off how the logo could be used in various contexts for the company. So to display the poster I created a final image which simultaneously presented the logo upon a car, a document, a shirt, and headphones.

I believe this project shows off not only my ability to design and think creatively, but also to work within specific constraints for a client; to work within a limited time frame, meet a specific purpose, and to respond to feedback.
